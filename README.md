# display-image-in-console
-- WARNING -- .bmp format must be at 24-bits colors, or it does not work, to convert it is needed to set the colors at 24 bits, there is also something about bmp format and endianity and or width, then it works at best if the image is a square, width = height. In any case something dipending from -> idx = (int) i*width + j; nice can be to replace i*width with an offset increasing but if a fully functional backend framework, made in, C , parsing json , pasting values in the html like php, with a custom database built from the bit level, is not able to get me an entry level position in web development or somewhere else i dont know what to do for you... Always remember, self defense is different to wake up and want violence ;) this you can tell to your collegues wife and first son, but is not relly how things work.
